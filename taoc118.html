				<p>I spent the morning gathering ingredients in the draw and along the river, returning around midday to start brewing potions, take inventory of my things, and read a little. This is a lovely spot for a hideout. The air is almost still and only occasionally can you feel it idle by on its way to the river. The cliff face absorbs sun for the second half of the day, cutting the chill of the cold river air. The evenings are warmer than the mornings, which are rather cold due to the shade from the cliffside, but I have plenty of money for blankets - nearly nine thousand septims! If my estimate is correct.</p>
