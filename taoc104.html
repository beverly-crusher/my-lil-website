				<p>behalf of the Ald’ruhn Mages’ Guild was not necessary - the Telvanni council had briefly outlawed all teleportation both to and from Sadrith Mora, so Skink-in-Tree's-Shade sent the potion with a courier on a trading vessel instead. Fortunately, he had a stock of them from some other research he and his colleagues are conducting: they are trying to discern what material vessels were historically used to produce these potions by cataloguing variation among side-effects in different manners of production and comparing these to those described in the artifact. He gave me one of the samples from their control group and I paid for a teleport to Ald’ruhn.</p>

				<p>Sadrith Mora is a dizzying place: the gorgeous, whimsically ornamented fungal architecture contrasts very strongly with the ragged clothing and missing teeth of the majority of the populace. I could not tell which were slaves and which were members of the house, except for the few people in cages. I hope to never return.</p>
				<p>The teleportation made me ill like usual. I spent a good portion of my afternoon apologizing to the Guild Guide and cleaning out the flower pot I threw up in.</p>
				<p>I am going to spend the night in the spare room here.</p>
