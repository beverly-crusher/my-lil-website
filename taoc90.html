				<p>I headed east from Molag Mar early in the morning, eating breakfast as I walked. Had I not had access to a good supply of water walking potions, I doubt I would have been able to make it as far as I did today: the trail snakes north around several long inlets, the first two thin enough to cross before a single potion wore off. The third inlet is much longer than the others, and the trail doesn’t turn back south on the opposite shore, instead turning north. I used nearly my whole stock water waking potions to navigate the series of islands - perhaps “large rocks” is more accurate - that perforate the coastal waters along</p>

				<p>the southern side of the eastern leg of Vvardenfell, before I reached the peninsula on which Azura’s temple is located.</p>
				<p>The foliage on Vvardenfell’s southeastern peninsula is different from anything else I have encountered: rather than mixed stands of Emperor Parasols and trees, the landscape is dominated only by emperor parasols, with an understory of Kreshweed, the plants far larger than anywhere else on the island, as tall or taller than I am most of the time. Ground cover is sparse, mostly short, dry grasses, rocky areas accented with various lichens and moss.</p>
