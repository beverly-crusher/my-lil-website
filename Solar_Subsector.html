		<h1>Solar Subsector</h1>
			<p>The Solar Subsector refers to the region of space within a distance from Sol of 8 parsecs spinward and trailing and 10 parsecs coreward and rimward.
			<br>It is bordered by Vega, Esperance, Dingir, Capella, Gemini, Kukulkan, Arcturus, and Banasdan in galaxy-wise (counter-clockwise) order from the coreward.</p>
			<p>The Solar Subsector was incoporated into <a class="link" href="The_First.html">The First</a> on 2741.6.5.1.
			<br>It is on the coreward frontier of The First. It has been in a slow and steady economic decline since its height in the 2800's. It remains only partially integrated, with most of its contributed hosts traveling toward the core of The First rather than integrating in their pre-existing social context.
			<br>The Solar Subsector's coordinates within the First are -08,12.</p>
