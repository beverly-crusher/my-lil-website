				<p>best an outlander can do in this city.</p>
				<p>I found the Mages' and Fighters' Guilds, filled out some paperwork, and found a job from each: I am to gather samples of mushrooms from the swamps along the bitter coast, 4 species in particular, for the Mages' Guild, and I am to clear out a cave rat infestation from someone's basement on the eastern side of Balmora.</p>
				<p>I headed south along the Odai River again until it grew dark. I am currently camped underneath one of the massive mushroom's canopies. I had a loaf of bread for dinner. I am completely out of money now; I will</p>

				<p>need to fend for myself until I can find some more. My plan for tomorrow is to gather the mushrooms in the morning, head back to Balmora and clear out the infestation in the afternoon should I still have time to do so. I intended to compile a list of my impressions of the alchemical uses of the endemic flora and fungi, but I am too tired to do so tonight.</p>
