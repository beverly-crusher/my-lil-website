New Cahokia is a small borderline world. It has a standard-density, ammonia-tainted atmosphere (requiring a filter) that produces a temperate climate. It has a moderate amount of surface water and low gravity. It has simple lifeforms and an uncomplicated ecosystem.<br>It has a population of tens of millions living in a industrial (early 20th century fashion. The population is ruled primarily by a captive government with a moderate law level.
<br>New Cahokia has the following major geographic features:
<ul>
<li>Alfa: uninhabited continent home to little native flora or fauna<ul>
<li>cyan-hued tundra
home to the planetary capital, riddled with a network of caves, and with many natural sites for outposts</li>
<li>rose-hued arid desert
 afflicted by frequent tectonic activity</li>
<li>yellow-hued plains
 with a large inland sea, and with a potential deposit of exotic materials</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bravo: uninhabited archipelago monopolised by a single lifeform<ul>
<li>red-hued tundra
 with a complicated river system, and with abundant sources of food</li>
