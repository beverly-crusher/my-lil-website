				<p>I asked Llethas to identify the enchantment on the "Boots of Blinding Speed" in lieu of payment. I was lucky not to put them on: they are literally "Blinding". While they will give the wearer the ability to run unnaturally fast, they also render them completely blind.</p>
				<p>I stopped by the Mages' Guild to see if they have work for me that doesn't involve assassination. The head of the guild has been struggling to find a copy of the Chronicles of Nchuleft in the locality, but has tracked a copy to Vivec. She gave me 250 gold to cover my expenses.</p>

				<p>I learned how the silt striders are piloted after a conversation with the local pilot: holes are cut into their shell through which long metal pins are inserted into their musculature beneath and manipulated or gyrated around in order to drive their movement in a particular corresponding direction. I think I will avoid their use if I can help it.</p>
				<p>I have spent the remainder of the day mapping out a route to Vivec: I plan to hike North to Maar Gan, then east to Gnisis, then turn south and follow the coast to Vivec. If I can gather supplies along the way and brew at night, I stand to make a lot of money hawking</p>
