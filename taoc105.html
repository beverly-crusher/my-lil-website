				<p>An addendum:</p>
				<p>I have been thinking more about the possibility of opening a practice here and it has resulted in a strong feeling that I should leave Vvardenfell. I had initially hoped that I could start an independent practice; that I could be an independent merchant, that addendum occasionally added to kindly given directions in nearly hushed tones: "I'd go to Cassius's practice - he's independent".</p>
				<p>Through my travels I have learned that "independent" means either they are a tinker or a pawnshop, or they are part of the Camonna Tong. The Guilds' presence in Vvardenfell</p>

				<p>is not particularly savory either; aside from the Ald'ruhn Guild, most seem to function as consolidations of Imperial power on Vvardenfell first, and a functioning Mages' Guilds second. Unfortunately, Ald'ruhn already has a resident Alchemist, and Anarenen's skill surpasses my own as he also possesses a great aptitude for magicka.</p>
				<p>I think an independent practice would struggle greatly with supply. I would need to broker deals with local farms in a way that doesn't cut into the supply of the Great Houses, the Camonna Tong, or the Guilds, and even should I be able to do that, Vvardenfell's agricultural</p>
