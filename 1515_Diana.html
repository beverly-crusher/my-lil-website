			<p>The system has 2 non-government factions: a minor non-charismatic leader, and a minor civil service beauracracy.</p>
			<p>The culture of the planet qualifies under indexes: 14, ritualized & 42, violent.</p>
			<p>Delos has a predictable, slow-moving storm cycle consiting of a number of perpetual storms. Its atmosphere is breathable for earthlings without a filter, but a notable number of the storms are hypoxic, and some carry toxins. Delos has native species similar to algae, lichen, and fungus. It has no native fauna. Delos's population primarily live in partially underground settlements of varying size ranging from small townships to large cities. Its capitol, Open Sky, sits on one of the few mountain ranges on the planet and only rarely does a storm's path cross through the city. Open Sky has a population of 1.1 million sophonts. Delosians typically refer to each other as 'siblings,' despite any lack of blood relation. Delos is ruled by the an oligarchic caste referred to as <i>Elder</i> (adj.), with a controlling senate of between 100 and 500 members. Elder Delosians wield a significant disparity of capital compared to other Delosians, and are expected to distribute it fairly among their <i>houses</i>, their portion of economically-dependent siblings. Delos has a stable economy operating in a capitalist fasion, but property & ownership is also determined through ritualized violence- even professions and social titles such as <i>Elder</i>. Delosians tend to favor hand combat, considering ranged weaponry to be impersonal, defeating the point of violence. Delos's other cities are ruled similarly to Open Sky. 
			<br>Delos's other factions consist of sophonts who live nomadically, relying on the algal blooms in the storms to provide their needs. These groups divide into two main cultures, called <i>Younger</i>, and the <i>Gardeners</i>. Younger siblings are led by an individual known by a title like <i>Little Brother</i>. They tend to follow the algal blooms of the storms, organizing into clans or tribes of loose familial organization that associate themselves with a particular storm. They practice algaculture for their primary food source, and raid elder siblings for their other needs, eschewing money. The Gardeners live according to a collectivist algacultural tradition, and consist of disparate people groups unified by common ideology. They tend to trade for what they need with elder and younger siblings, and are often relied upon as negotiators in the rare instances the two interact with common interest, particularly with their interactions with the rest of the First.</p>
<!--
Note: this system doesn't fit the UWP profile very well. The factions here present a unified face to The First, and cooperate despite entrenched (and stable) competition over resources. Warfare is ritualized and the culture is unified despite its disparate parts, so Delos interacts easily with the power structure of the first, but is strange compared to imperial culture.
The elder tithe most of the hosts required for the planet, but the younger do as well. The elder provide tithe via embryos, but the younger provide newborn infants and rarely children.
The younger are nearly entirely humans. There are a significant number of Ganymides at Open Sky, due to the low gravity and very humid air, but almost nowhere else due to the extreme hazard of the algal blooms for Ganymides if outside of habitation.

INTRO for the planet: a group of younger siblings have travelled to Open Sky to provide tribute - an older member, an infant and its young parent (who has also opted to act as tribute due to the bond they have developed... usually infants are proivded as tribute at birth- their trip took longer than they expected), and a couple who are going to provide tribute like the elder siblings do, with embryo. A Gardener from Open Sky is with them as legal liason. The older member is meeting an old elder friend - they fight to the death after an evening of celebration together. The winner goes to live the loser's life for a cycle as is custom prior to inheriting all their worldly posessions. (kill the one the players like more)
