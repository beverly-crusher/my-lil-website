			<p>The system has 1 non-government factions: A notable balkanized state(s).</p>
			<p>The culture of the planet qualifies under index: 43, peaceful.</p>
			<p>Drofn has an atmosphere with breathable amounts of oxygen for Earthlings, but a higher concentration of noble gases than is safe for long periods. Drofn has a hydrothermal profile similar to Ganymede and allows for cultivation of Ganymedean fauna & flora at lower depths of the ocean.
			<br>Initial colonization of Drofn was almost exclusively Ganymidean. GeDeCo established a plant refining noble gases on the planet in 2660 and has grown to eclipse the agrarian Ganymide economies on the planet.</p>
