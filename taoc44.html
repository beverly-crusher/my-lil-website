				<p>or Sulipund turned out to be the towns I was hoping for. The cave was lit via strategically cultivated Luminous Russula and large, glowing, translucent violet crystals. Manwe clearly knew what I was there for, as she paid me the late dues with little prompting, she even had them ready in a coin purse.</p>
				<p>Sulipund turned out to be closer to a town - or a building a least - a large, circular fort-like adobe. I accidentally knocked on a magickally trapped door intending to ask after Bereloth and it shocked me really badly. I sat in the entryway for a while until I felt better.</p>

				<p>Berelroth had several servants in his employ, and Sulipund was well-furnished. My meeting with the ex-telvanni went very well: he is a necromancer, and was obsessed with Cyrodiilic culture, specifically its legal outlook on necromancy (I suppose it makes sense that necromancy is illegal here) - for once my accent has helped me. I complimented him on his Cyrodiilic and he joined the guild with very little prodding, after only a cursory mention of the body of research and resources he would gain access to. I suspect that money is not an issue for him as it may be for Manwe.</p>
