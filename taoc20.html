				<p>I headed back to town, stopping at the residence of Miss Thelas (after knocking on a good number of doors - the woman who runs the Balmora Fightersâ€™ Guild is not a strong communicator and had grunted "the west side of town" when prodded for directions) to exterminate some unusually large rats that she was concerned would use her pillows for nesting material: she had a hoard of fine silk pillows piled atop her bed. I saved the tails and feet of the rats to use in potions and threw the bodies to the slaughterfish in the river.</p>

				<p>I returned to the Mages Guild and deposited the samples of the fungi species with Ajira, who then had me prank a colleague of hers by switching a soul gem in his desk with a fake one of her own design. Something so playful felt distinctly odd and a little unfamiliar to me, and it saddens me now that I am thinking on it more. In the moment I was just disoriented, and it had no effect on my mood. Afterwords, she gave me a list of plants that grow along the shores of the lake North of Pelgiad that she would like samples of. I traded her back my earnings for an alembic and a calcinator.</p>
