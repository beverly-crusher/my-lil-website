				<p>Addendum:</p>
				<p>Helga stayed here until dark. I tried shooing her back, but I think she could smell my food, because she didn’t leave like last time. Eventually, I saw an orange glow crept into the black of the night just above the western hillside of the draw, and a child's voice echoed "Helga!?" through the night a few times before receding further away from me along the fenced perimeter. I don’t know why, but I gathered up a few small potions, three each for Ataxia and Witbane, tied a makeshift lead to Helga's collar and took her back up the hill.</p>
				<p>Helga's family are six in number:</p>

			<section class="right-page">
				<p>Meten, her husband, Hestlar, both rather young, Meten's mother, Admaer, and three kids. I don't think the children had seen a dunmer before, but they were obviously very worried about Helga. Meten and Hestlar were busy cleaning up dinner and returned to do so after they discerned that I was not a threat, so I spoke mostly with Admaer, who I think is most like the leader of the family. I gave her the potions and told her and the kids that I am staying in the draw to the east of their farm, by the cliff.</p>
				<p>Which means that I think I am staying here now.</p>
