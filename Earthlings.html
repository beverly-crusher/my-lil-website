		<h1>Earthlings</h1>
			<p><i>Earthling</i> is the <a class="link" href="Solamani.html">Solamani</a> word used to describe members of the species of sophont native to Earth. In their own language (see below), they are called <i>humans</i>.</p>
		<h2>Biological Description <a class="link" href="The_Second.html">(The Second)</a></h2>
			<p>UHP: A72639, Earthlings are a species of sonfont native to the Sol system. They have an internally-structured bodyplan (referred to as <i>chordata</i> in their own description) with five limbs, one holding a head, two specialized for manipulation, and two specialized for ambulation. They are remarkably similar to many other members of <i>chordata</i>, especially to other <i>primates</i>, such as UHP:953526, Chimpanzees & UHP: 944826, Gorillas. Earthlings have short lifespans and reproduce rapidly. They are gonochoric, and give birth to live young after a period of internal gestation. They respirate manually using a pair of identical organs called <i>lungs</i>. They rely on digestion of food to create energy. Most Earthlings are reliant on sight as their primary means of interaction their environment.</p>
		<h2>Culture</h2>
		<h3>Language</h3>
			<p>Earthlings communicate primarily through sound emitted from their <i>mouth</i>, which is sensed by their <i>ears</i>. Earthlings also communicate visually, either through gestures made with their body or through written language. Earthlings tend to communicate more quickly through writing, but it is more difficult for them to learn than their other means of communication.</p>
		<h3>Insular</h3>
			<p>Earthling culture is fiercely individualistic. They tend to value personal achievement highly. They differentiate strongly between the individual and the group, but nonetheless participate readily in group behavior, both consciously and unconsciously. The combination of the two has led to a deeply pluralistic culture, even moreso than <a class="link" href="The_Second.html">The Second</a>. Depending on the subculture, earthlings can be either prone or averse to violence.</p>
		<h3>Interspecies Contexts</h3>
			<p>Earthlings are notable for developing interplanetary travel before the <a class="link" href="Ganymides.html">Ganymides</a> and are more adaptable to extraplanetary enviroments than Ganymides. Earthlings often work closely with Ganymides, and occaisionally integrate completely into Ganymidean society.</p>
			<p>Historical Earthling culture reacted violently to pairing with <a class="link" href="The_Second.html">The Second</a>, and this bias remains in traditional Earthling culture, which remains only partially integrated into <a class="link" href="The_First.html">The First</a>.</p>
			<p>During the <a class="link" href="Solamani.html">Solamani Accord</a>, the dominant Earthling cultures introduced measures limiting the production of Artificial Intelligences. Many Earthling cultures do not consider to Artificial Intelligences as equal, but some do. A somewhat common Earthling belief system holds simultaneously that Artificial Intelligences are capable of meeting all defining characterstics of sophonts (if not surpassing them), while not recognizing them as such, viewing them as a threat. Surprisingly, these more xenophobic ontologies do not always correspond to more violent pathology among a given subculture.</p>
			<p>A splinter faction of The Second has found common cause and even a sparse political autonomy rimward of the <a class="link" href="Solar_Subsector.html">Solar Subsector</a> with Artificial Intelligences and several Earthling subcultures.</p>
		<h2>Technology</h2>
			<p>Earthling technological (and material) culture is a blend of Earthling, Ganymide, and Second technologies.
			<br>Earthling culture places more emphasis on exploration and adventure than many others- the term <i>wanderlust</i> is uniquely of pre-Solamani Earthling origin.</p>
		<h2>Population Centers</h2>
			<p>Notable systems with high Earthling populations are Sol, α Centauri, Gaia, Hyperion, Soma, Gliese–Jahreiß, and Medaurus.</p>
