				<p>Alchemical properties: inconclusive - only one sample.</p>
				<p>Roobrush</p>
				<p>A low-lying shrub with woody stems and small, waxy leaves. Seems to prefer poor soil. Produces clusters of tiny, six-petaled white flowers that mature into hard dark-red or brown fruits. Has a distinct sweet and oily smell.</p>
				<p>Alchemical properties: laxative. Poisonous leaves.</p>

				<p>Slough Fern</p>
				<p>A large fern, grows at the foots of trees. The central fronds curl tightly into themselves and seem to produce more spores than the basal fronds, resulting in a "head" or "fruit" full of spores.</p>
				<p>Alchemical properties: the spores produce numbing and deadening effects - could induce paralysis at higher concentration?</p>
				<p>Stoneflower</p>
				<p>A species of orchid, grows in and among rocks or on sandy soil. Produces a few large grey-green basal leaves that fold downward</p>
