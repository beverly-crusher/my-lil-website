			<p>Risinium is the oldest settlement in the Medaurus system, dating to 749.8.4.2. It was launched as part of a salvo of colony ships from Sol, and served as an expedition deep into the then-uncharted frontier of the <a class="link" href="Solamani.html">Solamani Empire.</a>
			<br>Risinium served primarily as a port for surveying expeditions until the introduction of the jump drive with <a class="link" href="The_Second_Accord.html">The Second Accord</a>.
			<br>Risinium began a steady economic decline - its port became only necessary for the rare expedition into The Rim, and nearby systems (Soma & Keid) offered more attractive habitation.
			<br>The imperial presence splintered into a series of warring states. <a class="link" href="The_First.html">The First</a> issued a travel ban, and Risinium tore itself apart.
			<br>The fighting stopped in 2556, and the travel ban was lifted in 2576. The First restablished a starport and the old Solamani power structures were slowly rebuilt, brick by brick, by coporate interests with the capital to do so. The population began to grow again. 
			<br>Currently, Risinium has settled into a semi-peaceful arrangement of city-states, with three coporate interests dominating the governance of each: GeDeCo, SysGen, and Paragon.
			<br>The starport is located in the largest of these city-states: <i>Cenotaph.</i></p>
