			<p>The culture of the system qualifies under index: 14, ritualized.</p>
			<p>The system has a Class D Starport that is an independent-run freeport. The starport has light exterior defenses and no internal security services, and is lawless and harmonious. The starport is primarily used to purchase agricultural goods for interstellar shipping.</p>
			<p>Osiris has a large professional security force. The force is reasonably funded and basically equipped. It is disorganised and severely corrupt. The force's usual behaviour is very relucant to use force.</p>
