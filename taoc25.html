				<p>moisture environment of the swamp along the western coast of Vvardenfell, away from tree cover. It has a crown of thick, succulent leaves with toothed edges growing around a single central stalk. As it matures it likely develops new leaves on the new upward growth of the stalk and, as the old leaves are shaded out by the new, they die and droop down toward the stem, creating a shaggy mass of dead leaf husks that protects the stalk - likely great habitat for small animals. The leaves taste good, but I have not seen them in cultivation.</p>
				Alchemical properties: mostly inconclusive - not enough samples. Restorative and deadening.</p>
