				<p>Before I left Maar Gan I sold a good number of potions to the healers at the temple - an interesting place. It houses an artifact: a large stone that takes up nearly half the space within the temple. The inscription claims it to be a stone that Mehrunes Dagon once threatened the Dunmer with. Vivec taunted him, and Mehrunes Dagon threw the stone at Vivec, who easily dodged it, instead of the Dunmer. There is a dremora bound to the temple. "Go ahead. Taunt me," he said, through gritted teeth. (in baritone Cyrodiilic) I assume pilgrims repeat the actions of the divine in microcosm. This strikes</p>

I used a  levitation potion that I wasn't able to sell to scale a series of cliffs, and hiked down over the western side of the small ridge. The area is blanketed with thick fogs that roll in from the ocean. Thin grasses and large shrubs make up the understory of the sparse tree cover. I met a man heading to Maar Gan to raise the guard or muster mercenaries to rescue his wife from a group of daedric cultists</p>
