				<p>I slept a long time.</p>
				<p>I headed toward the coast, found the road, then cut south to Gnaar Mok. I sold a few potions to the merchant in town, then paid for passage on a boat to Hla Oad.</p>
				<p>I threw up twice during the short trip, I think only in part from seasickness. I managed to sell a few more potions while the crew exchanged some cargo and had lunch. Not much market for potions in either town, but a surplus of small, wax-sealed bottles for sale. After the crew had eaten, I paid for passage again to Seyda Neen.</p>
