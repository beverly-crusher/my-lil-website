			<p>Hermosillo has a Class A Starport with no downport but instead a web of orbital spaceports. The starport has standard exterior defenses and a First Imperial Military security service. <br>Hermosillo has a modest sized professional security force with 1 member party. The force is well funded and well equipped. It is near flawless competency and not very corrupt. The force's usual behaviour is a reclutance to use force.</p>
			<p>The system has 0 non-government factions: _.</p>
			<p>The culture of the planet qualifies under index: 56, Unusual Custom: Travel.</p>
			<p>Hermosillo has 2 starbases: a scout base, and a Traveller's Aid Society.</p>
			<p>Hermosillo was a major population center in the Solamani period. The economic gravity of the heart of the First rimward of "The Rim" slowly drew more and more of its population deeper into the heart of the empire, transforming Teegarden as a whole into more of a transit center. Hermosillo's economy is mostly focused on organizing and facilitating travel.</p>

			<p>Inverness Soar has a Class A planet-side starport with a spaceport restricted to use by the First Imperial Navy.</p>
			<p>The system has 2 non-government factions: a notable feudal technocracy and an obscure impersonal bureacracy.</p>
			<p>The culture of the planet qualifies under index: 15, Conservative.</p>
			<p>Inverness Soar has 2 starbases: a naval base and a Traveller's Aid Society Hostel.</p>
			<p>Inverness Soar has an atmosphere consisting primarily of methane and carbon dioxide, a small liquid water ocean on its surface, and water ice caps at its poles. In the Solamani era, habitation was limited to a research outpost, dedicated to studying the indigenous microbial life, unique for respirating methane rather than oxygen like the two instances of life indigenous to Sol. Current habitation consists of a large Ganymide colony and a smaller land-based colony, each isolated from the atmosphere. The two are primarily engaged in production of biochemicals and plastics. <br>Inverness Soar has strict regulations on planet-side egress from the colonies due to the volatile atmosphere and the indigenous microbial life. <br>Inverness Soar has a notably unusual weather pattern: a tri-annual summer firestorm-monsoon cycle, during which the heat of summer coincides with a regular solar flare cycle. The high temperature melts some of the ice at the poles, and the flare's radiation causes electrolysis of the evaporated water in the atmosphere - the resulting Oxygen gas combusts explosively with the methane atmosphere, setting off a chain reaction in which the increased heat sublimates water ice to water vapor, rises high enough to reach the electrolysis layer, and combusts. Electrolysis slows as the flare ends and massive rainstorms follow. This weather attracts enough tourists to warrant the presence of a Traveller's Aid Society Hostel on the southern edge of the northern ice cap.</p>
