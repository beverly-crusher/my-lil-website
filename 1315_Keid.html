			<p>*note: worldbuilding as of yet uncooked</p>
			<p>The system has 1 non-government factions: an obscure non-charistmatic leader.</p>
			<p>The culture of the planet qualifies under index: 12, religious.</p>
			<p>Vulcan serves as the base of naval operations and the primary X-boat waystation on The Rim. Vulcan's economy is somewhat dependent on their presence, as the two branches maintain the space elevator to the highport, where most of the planet's agricultural export is loaded onto massive interstellar freighters. Vulcan produces little other than food and is reliant on trade relations from the higher-population systems on the near side of the Rim.</p>
