			<p>The system has 1 non-government factions: an obscure representative democracy, known as the Kronnian Congress.</p>
			<p>The culture of the planet qualifies under index: 45, fashionable.</p>
			<p>The chlorine atmosphere has severely eroded the silicate-rich landmasses, leaving spindly stretches of less soluble ores and quartz-threaded rock behind. The oceans are highly acidic and very salty. They are typically shallow, lifeless, and brown. Occupation of Kronn began as a mining outpost, then expanded to a permanent settlement. Urbanization on Kronn is exclusively cthonic due to the intolerable atmosphere and strong radation from Stein 2051 B, known colloquially as Stein Bad. The microbial biomasses known as slime produce oxygen as a biproduct of photosynthesis. The upper echelons of Kronn's halls are vast atriums full of slime with windows cut into the surface overhead. Kronn lacks the technological expertise and production capacity to maintain most of their facilities, and spends a good deal of its GDP on technological contracts with the First to maintain its independence from megacorporate interests.</p>

</summary></details>
<details>
Kronn is a large hell world. It has a dense, corrosive mostly-chlorine atmosphere (requiring a vacc suit) that produces a boiling climate. It has a moderate amount of surface liquid and high gravity. It has microbial lifeforms that form colonies, colloquaially known as "slime."<br>It has a population of hundreds of millions living in a industrial (mid 20th century) fashion. The population is ruled primarily by a charismatic oligarchy with a high law level. The local population cannot independently maintain their life support systems at their current level of technology.
<br>Kronn has the following major geographic features:
<ul>
<li>Alfa: uninhabited archipelago<ul>
<li>rose-hued barren land
 plagued by especially violent weather, and with many natural sites for outposts</li>
