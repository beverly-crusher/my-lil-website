				<p>Black Anther</p>
				<p>Looks to be a species of lily, with dark green foliage and purple flowers with black anthers. Grows in the understory of shrubs and trees, but not in full shade. Odd for it to be named after its black anthers and not its beautiful flowers given that they are so striking, with no other plants similar to it that I have encountered.</p>
				Alchemical properties: the anthers brewed alone create a feeling of sluggishness. The petals and stems create a simple brew that also reduces sensitivity to light (very novel - the reduction is pigmented very dark green or brown or purple</p>

			<section class="right-page">
				<p>depending on the ratio of flowers to foliage used, nearly black). I suspect that in higher concentration it could induce temporary blindness.</p>
				<p>Chokeweed</p>
				<p>A shrub that grows in rocky soil, with large fronds of compound leaves and a stem that is woodier the older it is - the tips of the fronds are fully vegetal. Did not observe any flowers, must flower earlier in spring or later in the season.</p>
				<p>Alchemical properties: inconclusive. Makes a good-tasting tea, earthy and not too bitter.</p>
