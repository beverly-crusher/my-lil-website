			<p>The system has 1 non-governmental factions: colony.</p>
			<p>The culture of the system qualifies under index: 54, unusual custom: technology.</p>
			<p>The main population of the planet lives on the largest landmass in a subterranean fashion due to the intense luminosity (1240 L<sub>â˜‰</sub>) of Alula Borealis. A colony of a higher tech level was settled in 2945 under the ocean, northwest of the largest landmass. The two populations do not maintain contact with each other- it is likely the principle population lacks the technology to find the undersea colony.</p>
