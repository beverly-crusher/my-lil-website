			<p>Triuk is a primarily agricultural planet with a turbulent past - the nonviolent revolutions of 2941-3 drew attention from social organizers systems away, until its new leader failed to deliver on their promises. A biological weapon perminately decommissioned the spaceport in 2958- the perpetrator remains unknown to this day. The new leadership's rapid militarization after this incident accelerated the then-peaceful second rebellion into frequent violence.</p>
