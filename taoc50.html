				<p>27 of Last Seed</p>
				<p>On my way back to Balmora, I stopped in to see if I could find Larrius Varro - he told me a tale in euphemism (like I were a child - full of "bad men, officer, good guy, etc.") of great political corruption within the Imperial/Hlaalu political interface, and said that if a certain "bloodbath" were to occur, the corruption could be alleviated. Damn.</p>
				<p>I told him he had the wrong idea about me - I am an alchemist, not a political assassin - and left.</p>
				<p>I wonder now if I have been added to his little list of "bad men" due</p>

				<p>for a "bloodbath" and whether he ever thought to include himself on the list.</p>
				<p>The dwemer ruin is just up the hill from Fort Moonmoth, so with my rope in hand, I went to explore.</p>
				<p>A horrible dust storm kicked up when I neared the peak. I wedged the rotating door open with a large stone, fastened my rope to a sconce protruding from the entryway wall, and began my short-lived expedition: upon rounding the first bend, I found myself staring into a large cavern lit by torches, populated by a group of bandits, mostly human I think.</p>
