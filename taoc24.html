				<p>Comberry</p>
				<p>Large shrubs that seem to need rich, wet soil to grow. They have broad, waxy leaves and are full of very sweet, very bitter, oblong, red fruits a little larger than a grape with large pits. The innkeep in Pelgiad told me the fruits are made into Shein and then Greef, but I have not seen them in cultivation as of yet. I hereby resolve to taste the spirits the next time I have some money and a free evening.</p>
				<p>Alchemical properties: inconclusive. Clearly have some inherent magicka but must need a specific focus or catalyst to bring out specific properties, which I have yet to find.</p>

				<p>Corkbulb root</p>
				<p>Small trees centered around a single central trunk like a cabbage, but the leaves are spaced further apart, have serrated edges, and do not form a head like a cabbage does, more like a core akin to celery. Form a comically large taproot, the thick outer skin of which develops into a firm, porous material very similar to cork. I have not seen one fruiting or in flower yet.</p>
				<p>Tastes watery, a little sweet and bitter, and has a smooth texture like a potato. They are commonly cultivated. I have been eating a lot of Corkbulb root - not bad! - but I desperately want bread.</p>
