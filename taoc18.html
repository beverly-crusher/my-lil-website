				<p>20 of Last Seed, 427</p>
				<p>I was awoken by another of the bugs that woke me a few days ago, this one inspecting my feet to see if I were in fit condition to be scavenged. I left my sword at hand for that very reason, and dispatched it easily. I tried to sleep again but was unable to do so, so I set off in the dark toward the mine.</p> 
				<p>Two figures were standing around a fire outside the mine again. Likely a different shift on break than from the last time, but I did not stop to say hello as I imagine I would have seemed a bandit. Ajira, who I was to gather the mushrooms for, had said the swamp was just over</p>

				<p>the ridge along the river - I found a navigable way up and then down into the swamp.</p>
				<p>I spent the morning gathering mushrooms and other potentially usable plants in the various pools. I chanced upon a footpath, but saw a lone figure with a large battleaxe standing by a bridge a ways down the road. I was not born yesterday. I don't think they saw me, but if they did, I doubt I look like I'd be worth the effort of a shakedown - still - I did not chance it, and picked my way back to the ridge through the swamp instead.</p>
				<p>I encountered one of the 'Cliff Racers' mentioned in the traveler's guide</p>
