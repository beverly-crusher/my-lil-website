				<p>experiment on myself (hence the vast amounts of clean water required). The last potion I made turned out to be more of a poison and after I stopped vomiting, I was so hungry that I ate nearly an entire mudcrab despite its horrible (muddy) flavor.</p>

				<p>Draggle-tail</p>
				<p>Aquatic with terrestrial roots, grows in the still pools of the swamps along the western coast of Vvardenfell. The leaves join the stem at the water level, or shoot off of the stem from below the water level</p>

				<p> and grow upward to float on the surface of the water. The flowers are pale blue and cup-shaped, flaring out at the base, with a long yellow style. Once mature, the ovaries form large, translucent pods that fill with a sickly-sweet liquid. The seeds develop along a central axis of flesh within the fruit that joins to the pod at the tip and stem.</p>
				<p>Alchemical properties: The petals, flesh of the fruit, and, to a greater extent, the liquid within the fruit have a lifting or lightening effect. Seeds have a deadening, numbing, or paralyzing effect depending on potency. Pollen creates a mild high that has a corresponding mental effect to the seeds.</p>
